    <p>My preferred beverage of choice would be an iced ube matcha latte from Communal Coffee in North Park. I love the flavors in the drink and they match so well with each other. It is such a light drink and not too sweet at all, especially if you substitute the milk with oat milk. I first had this drink a couple of days back when I was in the area and has been my favorite since then. I would recommend everyone to try it out because it is only a seasonal drink.</p>
